Test Data for SPECTRL2 and SOLPOS
=================================

This folder contains the original C/C++ source test files from NREL for
SPECTRL2 and SOLPOS.

Use the Windows SDK 7 command shell to set up an x64 release environment. Then
use ``nmake`` to clean, create build directory, compile and test both solar
utilities. The output is displayed in the terminal. Executables and object
files are in the build folder.
